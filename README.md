# Mattermost API QuickCheck instances

This library provides QuickCheck Arbitrary instances for data
structures defined in the Mattermost API package
(https://github.com/matterhorn-chat/mattermost-api).  Importing this
library allows clients of the mattermost-api library to write
QuickCheck tests based on types from that library.
